IpLogger Package

============================

These two programs let you log tcp and icmp connections in syslog, along
with the hostname. They are just something I whipped up quickly, and could
be improved alot - especially the icmp logging program.


tcplog
   This program logs all tcp connections to your host. It also makes a
attempt at detecting the ftpbounce attack described by hobbit at avian.org
(read ftpbounce.txt included in this archive for a description of the
attack). The way we detect it is if a privledged (0-1023) connect comes on
source port 20, we log it as a ftp bounce attack. Connections on source port
20 to non privledged ports are not logged at all - we assume those are ftp
transfers, and ignore them. I would like to do the same with DCC
connections, if anyone knows how - email me.

icmplog
   This program logs most icmp packets, or atleast the interesting ones (we
dont, for instance, log echo_replies). The ICMP logging could provide alot
more information than it does, and I might add more information in the
future, but for now, it serves well enough.
